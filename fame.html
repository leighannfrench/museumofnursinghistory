          <p class="flex2"> Gale Catherine Garner, of Norfolk, was a dedicated and compassionate Registered Nurse, trained in the tradition of Florence Nightingale at the historic Philadelphia General Hospital School of Nursing. She attended the University of Pennsylvania and Loyola University (Chicago), completing a B.S. in Nursing. Caring for others, and empowering women and families was the center of Gale’s professional and personal life. Early in her career she took part in Medical Relief operations abroad, and soon after she combined her personal, academic and professional passions to continue helping others. Gale was an enthusiastic volunteer curator and board member of the Museum of Nursing History in Philadelphia.Gale began her nursing career in 1962 as a Public Health Nurse in Philadelphia and was soon a nursing instructor at Northwestern University’s Wesley Memorial Hospital in Chicago. In the span of her long career, she specialized in home health, hospice, gerontology and psychiatric nursing. She had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and growth, which she inspired and facilitated in others, no matter the age.
Gale was a pioneering advocate for impaired nurses struggling with substance abuse. For over 30 years, she used her knowledge of mental health issues and chemical dependence to help others and raise awareness in the medical field. She created and led the Peer Assistance to Chemically Dependent Nurses (PACDN) program for the Virginia Nursing Association and was a facilitator for the Support Group for Impaired Health Professionals. Her caring guidance, kind encouragement and loyal friendship are cherished in the local AA and NA community.

        <h3>We Remember Carol Ann (Killian) Desroches</h3>

        <div class="flex-container">

          <img class="hall_image flex1" src="img/placeholder.jpg">

          <p class="flex2">My mother, Carol Ann (Killian) Desroches, RN graduated from St. Luke’s Hospital School of Nursing in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1969 (school was in operation from 1884 to 1975).
In searching for a museum online to preserve my mother nurse’s cape, I found the Museum of Nursing History.
I liked that the museum was conceived by and run by nurses, so I wanted to offer her nurse’s cape* and other items to its permanent collection so my mother would be remembered for a profession she so loved. It was also reassuring that the museum was affiliated with LaSalle University with its organizational stability and resources.
My mother worked in labor and delivery at Morton Hospital in Taunton, Massachusetts upon graduation, and died in 1990 at the age of 41 from breast cancer when I was 15. I always knew my mother loved being a nurse, but at that young age, I just knew she “delivered babies.”
At her funeral, and for months thereafter, my family received many cards and letters testifying to what an incredible nurse she was. One woman approached me and said, “Your mother saved my granddaughter’s life.”
A fellow nurse wrote and told a story of how my mother counseled a young woman who had a baby born with Down’s Syndrome. The new mother didn’t want to hold her baby, so my mother shared personal stories about her sister with Down’s.  The woman eventually accepted her baby and later came back to the hospital in tears to thank my mother for her compassion and caring.
Now my mother’s cape has a good home where it will help tell the story of nursing in America.
